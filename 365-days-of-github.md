# 365 Days of GitHub

### 1
Hey, everyone! My name is Jackie Luo, and I’m here to talk about my year of GitHub.

Malcolm Gladwell wrote that you need ten thousand hours of practice to be an expert in any area—in fact, he specifically talks about software engineers, like Bill Gates, who hit his ten thousand hours of programming before he ever founded Microsoft. I mean, I don’t know about becoming an expert in computer science, much less a world-class one, but I know I did *not* have ten thousand hours of practice.

You see, in high school, I was passionate about tech, but my day-to-day interest was fashion. I started shooting photography at fifteen, and I worked with modeling agencies in places like New York, Paris, and Milan. I founded a fashion magazine that hit 1.5 million readers worldwide, and I launched a nonprofit that held an annual benefit fashion show to showcase student designers. I must have hit at least a few thousand hours there, but the more I got into it, the more I realized that it was never going to fulfill me. I think that fashion can be one of the greatest forms of art there is—you see it, you wear it, it moves. But, even today, the fashion industry can still be really superficial, and I didn’t feel like I could make an impact on the world the way I wanted. Still, I don’t regret the time and effort that I spent in it because it’s a big part of how I got to where I am now. My photography gained most of its popularity through online communities on Flickr and Tumblr, and that same group of young people were both the featured artists and readers of the magazine I started. I was just a sophomore in high school, and these platforms on the internet gave me huge reach that would have been impossible just a decade before that.

I decided to add a major in computer science at the start of my sophomore year. At that point, the extent of my knowledge of programming was some HTML/CSS and Codecademy-level Python. I took my first CS class that fall. What I quickly realized, though, was that I was behind pretty much everyone else I knew, people who had been learning since high school and middle school. I think that's the case for a lot of women who don't come into college knowing that they want to be CS majors. And so I decided to start learning on my own. My aim was to code every single day for a year. Since I started in January, I’ve become proficient in Python, Java, C++, Ruby, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I’ve built or worked on six apps and solved around five or six hundred programming problems. And it's given me an edge. I interned this summer at Percolate, a startup in New York, where I was chosen as the youngest of seven engineering interns out of hundreds of candidates. Beyond that, I feel more empowered and more capable, and I’ve learned more than I thought was possible.

You know, last year this time, I was struggling to push my first commit to GitHub. I don’t think that my way’s the only way, but I do think that putting in that time—putting in the effort—makes a huge difference. A lot of people didn’t take me seriously when I said I was going to major in computer science, given my background in fashion. I was the girl who photographed models and went to New York Fashion Week every season, and that’s the polar opposite of how people view software engineers. Now? They do.
